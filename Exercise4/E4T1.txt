# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
- Update security group attached with target instance to limit only trusted IP can execute ssh to Web instance
- Not allow password login, use private key to login instead

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
- Block public access to S3 recipes bucket, limit only necessary instance can be access
- Turn on setting of server side encryption for bucket
- Setting access control list (ACL) for bucket to allow who can read/write to target bucket
