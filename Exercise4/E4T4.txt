# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
- Remove ingress and egress connection to internet from Security group
- Put Web instance at private subnet

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
- according to documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-bucket-policies-vpc-endpoint.html
 -> I think we can implement solution

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No, according to https://aws.amazon.com/vi/blogs/storage/encrypting-existing-amazon-s3-objects-with-the-aws-cli/#:~:text=Amazon%20S3's%20default%20encryption%20can,objects%20in%20the%20same%20bucket.
-> we can not apply setting for exist data in bucket

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
- Original template include many security uncompilance and does not meet least security privillege -> make an unsecured system
